      Hi Codeforces.<br/>
Recently there have been several improvements on the website. A little later, I will write a short note about them. Here I want to tell about a noticeable new functionality that has recently been implemented by kuviman.
Sometimes after the end of a round there are requests in comments to add a particular test. And problem writers or coordinators add it manually. Now this process is automated.<br/>
Meet the uphacking phase!<br/>
Now, after the end of almost any contest, participants from Div.1 have the opportunity to hack any solution in this contest during the week. Yes, including official solutions from rounds. In case of successful hacking:<br/>
Your test will be automatically added to the problem and will be used in the future when testing new solutions for this problem;<br/>
If a hacked solution is a practice (i.e. upsolving), then its verdict will change to “hacked” otherwise its verdict will remain unchanged;<br/>
The participant whose solution has been hacked will be notified via system private message<br/>;
Each solution can be successfully hacked only once.<br/>
In order to add only adequate and reasonable tests, it is forbidden to hack solutions that intentionally contain a mistake. Please strictly follow this rule. It is because of the possibility of inadequate behavior that we cannot open uphacking for everyone.<br/>
I hope that this innovation will be useful and tests for problems will become even better!<br/>

UPD: Probably, later we will extend uphacking phase and reduce the rating bound.<br/>
